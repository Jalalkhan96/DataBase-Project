# 🛡️ Advanced Query Features

This section outlines advanced query techniques that can help you manage and analyze your data more efficiently.

## 🔍 **Nested Queries**

Nested queries, also known as subqueries, allow you to retrieve hierarchical and related data in a single query.


## 🔗 Union Queries

Union queries combine the results of multiple `SELECT` queries into a single result set, allowing you to view data from different tables in one consolidated result.

## 🔄 Mixed Queries

Mixed queries involve combining different query types, such as **joins**, **nested queries**, and **filters**, to analyze complex datasets.
